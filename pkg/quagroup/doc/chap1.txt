  This is the manual for the [1mGAP[0m package [1mQuaGroup[0m, for doing computations with
  quantized enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras.
  
  Apart  from the chapter you are currently reading, this document consists of
  two  chapters.  In Chapter [1m2.[0m we give a short summary of parts of the theory
  of  quantized  enveloping algebras. This fixes the notations and definitions
  that  we  use.  Then in Chapter [1m3.[0m we describe the functions that constitute
  the package.
  
  The          package          can          be          obtained         from
  [34mhttp://www.math.uu.nl/people/graaf/quagroup.html[0m  The directory [1mquagroup/doc[0m
  contains  the  manual  of  the  package in [1mdvi[0m, [1mps[0m, [1mpdf[0m and [1mhtml[0m format. The
  manual was built with the [1mGAP[0m share package [1mGAPDoc[0m, [LN01]. This means that,
  in order to be able to use the on-line help of [1mQuaGroup[0m, you have to install
  [1mGAPDoc[0m before calling [22m[34mLoadPackage("quagroup");[0m.
  
  The   main   algorithm   of  the  package  (on  which  virtually  the  whole
  functionality  relies)  is  a  method  for computing with so-called PBW-type
  bases, analogous to Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt bases in universal enveloping
  algebras.  In  both  cases  commutation relations between the generators are
  used.  However, in the latter case all commutation relations are of the form
  yx=xy+z,  where  x,y  are  generators,  and  z  is  a  linear combination of
  generators.  In  the  case of quantized enveloping algebras the situation is
  generally  much  more  complicated. For example, in the quantized enveloping
  algebra of type E_7 we have the following relation:
  
  [22m[35m---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0m
    [22m[35mF62*F26 = (q)*F26*F62+(1-q^2)*F28*F61+(-q+q^3)*F30*F60+(q^2-q^4)*F31*F59+[0m
    [22m[35m          (q^2-q^4)*F33*F58+(-q^3+q^5)*F34*F57+(q^4-q^6)*F35*F56+[0m
    [22m[35m          (q^-1-q-q^5+q^7)*F36*F55+(q^6)*F54[0m
  [22m[35m------------------------------------------------------------------[0m
  
  Due  to  the  complexity  of  these commutation relations, some computations
  (even with rather small input) may take quite some time.
  
  Remark:   The   package   can   deal   with  quantized  enveloping  algebras
  corresponding  to  root systems of rank at least up to eight, except E_8. In
  that  case  the computation of the necessary commutation relations took more
  than  2  GB. I wish to thank Steve Linton for trying this computation on the
  machines in St Andrews.
  
  The following example illustrates some of the features of the package.
